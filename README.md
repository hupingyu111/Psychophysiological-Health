## Supplementary Table S1: Feature List

This repository contains the supplementary materials for our research on physiological and psychological feature analysis.

### Content Description

**Supplementary Table S1** provides a comprehensive list of all 91 features used in our study, including:

- **Feature Number**: Sequential numbering (1-91)
- **Feature Name**: Standardized English terminology for each measurement
- **Unit**: Measurement units (mmHg, bpm, ms, Hz, mV, Î¼V, %, scores, ratios)
- **Category**: Classification of features into functional groups

### Feature Categories

The 91 features are organized into the following categories:

1. **Blood Pressure** (Features 1-8): Systolic/diastolic pressure measurements and variability indices
2. **Blood Pressure Recovery** (Features 9-14): Recovery rates for blood pressure parameters
3. **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** (Features 15-29): Time and frequency domain HRV measures
4. **HRV Recovery** (Features 30-40): Recovery rates for HRV parameters
5. **EEG** (Features 41-52): Electroencephalography power spectral and complexity measures
6. **Electrogastrography** (Features 53-64): Gastric electrical activity measurements
7. **Pulse Wave** (Features 65-76): Pulse wave analysis parameters
8. **Psychological** (Features 77-91): Standardized psychological assessment scores
